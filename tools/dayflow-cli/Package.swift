import PackageDescription

// Phase 1 of the TAKT CLI: a standalone, read-only executable.
//
// It deliberately has no dependencies. SQLite comes from the system SDK, and
// argument parsing is hand-rolled, so this builds with `swift build` alone and
// can later be folded into TAKT.app as an Xcode target without dragging any
// package resolution along with it.
